# NFTMetadata_Generator
The Mickey DeGods are hand-crafting "Combos": pfp NFTs that are based on the menu items each customer submits. A user can submit up to five menu items to be made into a Combo. Our artist Fox Bellafonte hand-crafted these beautiful pfps himself and the attributes associated with each NFT are unique. This script is meant to process aggregate NFT attribute data and create individual NFT json files.

## Quick Start:
1. Start with a CSV file with a header row formatted to match the attributes mentioned in the .py script.
2. This CSV can be nicely converted to JSON using this site (or many others like it): https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm
3. After your JSON is created, just name it as the script expects, and each individual line item in your spreadsheet will become its own NFT JSON file.
These files live inside the './metadata' folder
